        <article><p>When I was 18 (2004), I got my first real job at Nordic Furniture of Markdale ON. We made danish-style minimalist chairs and tables. In early 2005 I and other lower seniority workers in the factory were laid off. It hobbled on for another few years before going out of business for good. The furniture was high quality, the prices didn’t change, but people’s willingness to pay for quality had dropped. This story is not an uncommon one in Southern Ontario.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I have for a long time liked the idea of tariffs. They would make a lot of manufactured goods more expensive which I think would be a good thing. Food and housing is domestically produced so that would mostly be unaffected, so clothes, electronics and that sort of thing would be the main source of the price increases.</p>

<p>We throw away too much of clothing, appliances, electronics etc. and the incentives are toward the poorly made and the disposable. A tariff would increase the price, and then quality components and fabrics would make a smaller percentage of the bill of goods as either labour or tariffs would necessarily make up a larger part. Thus, there would be a smaller percent difference between higher quality goods and lower quality goods, which should do something to drive customers toward buying things that last longer and thus have a lower overall environmental impact. Further, if you pay more, it might be worth repairing some of what we currently dispose.</p>

<p>The environmental aspect of the production and disposal of these items has been in many cases shifted overseas to places with fewer environmental regulations and thus the net pollutants per item made is higher than it would be if it stayed at home. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>That’s my case for tariffs. The case against is that it makes the economy smaller than it would otherwise be,<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> which I think is an accurate criticism, just one that I don’t think should dominate all other concerns. In the United States, one of the candidates is proposing a 10% across the board tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> You can guess which one. On one hand he’s proposing to implement one of my most dear and neglected policies and on the other he’s somewhat erratic and reactive. I can’t vote anyway, but I will be watching this space with interest.</p>

<hr />

<p>Note regarding the 1st 2 sources. You need to read between the lines a little to see the effects of tariffs on the industries.</p>

<p>14 hours in Numbers</p>

<p>11 hours in the terminal</p>

<p>10 hours of Alcumus</p>

<p>9 hours of minesweeper</p>

<p>That is what <a href="https://manytricks.com/timesink/">time sink</a> reports of my usage since April of 2023, much of it underestimated because of the way that the website shows URLs (reddit and <em>cough</em> YouTube), though perhaps some overestimates caused by me not sleeping my computer when I leave it (my AoEII score is an overestimate, I think—<em>I hope</em>).</p>

<p>In one sense, I chose to do all of that. Inasmuch as it makes sense for me to refer to something as me, it makes sense to say that I chose to do all of that. My desire to watch YouTube or play Age of Empires is no less a part of me than my desire to coordinate soccer in my community, learn new things or my creative impulses.</p>

<p>There is a contrast between those desires though. Some last longer than others. That means that some parts of me last longer than others. What do we then make of those things?</p>

<p>Self identity is a tough nut to crack and I have not cracked it. That won’t prevent me from talking about it though. In the most trivial sense, there is no such thing. A millisecond from now, I will not be precisely identical to what I was before. Ten years from now, I will be so different, that in some sense the person writing this will have died.</p>

<p>Practically though, there is some sort of through line. I have memories of my early childhood. I have many of the same desires and proclivities. Perhaps like a parabola’s values taken at different points along its journey, there is a sameness. $y=x^2$ is $1$ at$ x=1$ and $25$ at $x=5$. While both the values and the slopes are different at those different locations, there is an underlying continuity and sameness to that parabola.</p>

<p>I don’t know if we are like a parabola though.</p>

<p>What am I getting at? I’m suggesting—and to be clear, I don’t have an argument really—that it makes sense to prioritize the parts of me that endure longer. That there is death in abandoning ones longer term desires and goals for shorter term ones.</p>

<p>Not abandoning the longer-term goals and desires requires slowing down though. If I am on the YouTube autosuggestion train or playing round after round of some online multiplayer game, that is a very short-term part of me that is making those choices. I don’t think a week from now I will care nearly as much about whatever technology announcement occurred or I will be nearly so tilted about losing that previous round such that I need to play another one. In the moment, however, I very much do care, and if I cared more about the other things in the moment, I would do those things.</p>

<p>In those moments where the choice is so easy that it doesn’t even feel like I’m making a choice, that is when indecision can actually be helpful. I have been using another app called <a href="https://onefocusapp.com">1focus</a> . This one allows me to suspend against my will my browser tabs and selected apps. It is like a version of myself reaching out from the grave and yanking the plug , so in a sense that person has some life and some effect in the world still.</p>

<p>At any moments to put limits on oneself is to give up some control; however if you don’t make any commitments to future actions, then that is also a limit on control: there is no easy way out of it. The control exerted by the past self comes at the expense of the current self, and the current self control comes at the expense of the future self’s control. It’s like how the parliament (in Canada) made a constitution and have had their actions subsequently limited by that constitution. In a real sense, they are less sovereign than the group that made it. However, undermining the constitution, and thus the sovereignty of the group that made the constitution, would undermine their own sovereignty. And that is what I am doing when I place limits on the actions I can to fulfill my short term desires. While it does mean I loose some control of my future acts, the control over my actions exerted by my future self is predicated on my ability to follow through in the present and the past, as I undermine my control over my actions when I don’t follow through.</p>

<p>This is where some indecision is helpful. As I said earlier, I use an app called <a href="https://onefocusapp.com">1focus</a> to snap me out of binge computing. This will create a space of indecision for me where the next action is not so easy or automatic. Unpleasant though it can be, indecision means that the less loud, but more enduring desires get a chance to be heard: it gives me space to choose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The science of GLP-1 agonists has often zigged, and now it might zag. GLP-1 produces all sorts of cascading effects; the human body has receptors for it not only in the gut but also in the liver, muscles, and brain. Studies keep turning up surprises: some of the medications appear to reduce the incidence of heart attacks and strokes, slow the progression of kidney disease, and shrink dangerous fat deposits in the liver. People who take them have reported diminished cravings for alcohol and tobacco; some have reported feeling less compelled to gamble, compulsively pick at their skin, and engage in other addictive behaviors. “It’s an unprecedented situation,” Christian Hendershot, a University of North Carolina clinical psychologist who is studying semaglutide’s effect on alcohol use, told me. “The anecdotal reports of people saying these drugs are helping them cut back on drinking or smoking have come much faster than our clinical studies can confirm.” Lizard venom helped to turn an obscure hormone into potent diabetes medications, and then into the most promising weight-loss treatments in history. We’re still discovering how much they’ll change our lives.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2023/11/10/NDT,-theodicy-and-cattle.html">Neil deGrasse Tyson, Theodicy and Cattle</a></h2>
        <em class="postDate">10 Nov, 2023</em>
        <article><p>This essay starts with an extremely careless tweet from a very smart person</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/NDT-steak.webp" alt="NDT on Cattle" /></p>

<p>The most obvious critique is that we did not create the cow from nothing. We molded a conscious being from another animal—the aurochs—over the course of some 8000 years or whatever. We repurposed it, but a lot remains from the before times. The cattle still have desires and still have feelings given to them by their evolutionary heritage. They care about their young ones. They want community such as theirs is. They maybe even want freedom; they do break out sometimes. I don’t know the extent of it. We can’t really know, because the cow can’t tell us.</p>

<p>But I think the proper critique goes further. What if we had created the cow from whole cloth and it did experience what we subject it to? The cow has no power over us. We are far more powerful than the cow. A single person could kill millions of cows and only rarely will cows kill people. The power differential is insane. There are no situations wherein the cow can avenge their experience.</p>

<p>Given the power imbalance, this situation seems outside the bounds of the normal types of morality that we are used to thinking about. These moralities mostly have to do with actions towards and from our approximate equals. Don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t kill, be polite, don’t slander. Basically prohibitions on the things that if you do them you corrode the very social ties that make society possible.</p>

<p>Then there are the moralities to with cleanliness and so on, wash your hands before you eat, don’t litter etc. Very helpful not getting you or your friends killed by disease.</p>

<p>I do think that those are at the core of human morality, but I think there is more. I also think there is the morality of the extremely powerful. A striking example I can think of is the Indian Emperor Ashoka who suddenly stopped a brutal and effective expansionist policy after the slaughter of about 300 000 by his army. There was nothing stopping him other than his own unwillingness to cause further bloodshed. It strikes me as a good choice for him to make, given that the incentives were mostly in the other direction. It is a sort of morality for the gods. When it is not negative consequences for the self, but a self conception that one judges ones self against that determines the rightness of the action. This is the sort of morality I think applies to us and our agricultural animals.</p>

<p>Luckily, we have a—somewhat limited by perspective that it is—tradition of morality for the gods to draw from. These are called theodicies. They offer a fairly relevant perspective in this case.</p>

<p>A theodicy is basically an attempt to answer the paradox pointed by Epicurus who is said to have said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God, either wants to eliminate bad things and cannot, or can but does not want to, or neither wishes to nor can, or both wants to and can. If he wants to and cannot, then he is weak and this does not apply to god. If he can but does not want to, then he is spiteful which is equally foreign to god’s nature. If he neither wants to nor can, he is both weak and spiteful, and so not a god. If he wants to and can, which is the only thing fitting for a god, where then do bad things come from? Or why does he not eliminate them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are plenty of theodicies that we can get into and I think they will help hammer the point home, but for right now we can think about how it begins to apply to us too, albeit somewhat loosely because we are not all powerful and some of us would not claim to be good or desire to be good.</p>

<p>So what kind of answer do we give the cow? This animal who we had a hand in creating. Cattle are perhaps a less ideal example because they are more efficient for the amount of suffering we are causing a conscious being compared to others for the amount of protein output we get from them. For example, basically four people are fed per chicken. 10 months of torturous conditions for the chicken in which they do not have the freedom to act the way that they would if they could choose. They are subjected to quarters and crowding that are unhealthy for them and which cause decimations. Even cattle though, the dairy industry is already industrialized in America and is becoming more so in Canada. Feed lots for beef cattle are crowded, restrictive and unsanitary.</p>

<p>So those are the evil conditions. We have the power to stop them, or at least reduce them by reducing our own consumption. Or maybe it is justifiable by the logic of one of history’s great theodicies. Let’s try a few.</p>

<p>Leibniz claimed that this is the best of all possible worlds. I don’t think we could claim that for ourselves. We could easily reduce the suffering we inflict on these animals. We don’t need to have meat grown on a farm. We would be just fine—we would be healthier in fact—if we didn’t.</p>

<p>How about the Brothers Karamazov or to some extent Augustine’s? Rebellion. God created the space for something different from him and it rebelled and that is the source of suffering in the world. I have trouble believing that about domestic animals. It’s not their rebellion that causes their suffering. It’s not them being wicked, though perhaps sometimes they are anti-social and that does cause some suffering, but I would say they are so in fairly predictable ways and we could alleviate that. As far as creating something separate from ourselves that is not necessarily good because we are good, I’m not sure it even makes sense.</p>

<p>There is Hick’s view that it is preparatory. We live in a world that teaches us things through suffering—and that is true of our world—but <em>that</em> crucially depends on an afterlife. I don’t know what kind of afterlife you ascribe to animals. I am prone to think that their souls are destroyed with their bodies. It’s up to you. If you think there is some cow heaven the suffering that we have caused them will be meaningful, maybe. Though one large difference regardless of your view is that we are not doing this for their benefit.</p>

<p>There’s the Howard-Snyder theodicy which I find fairly interesting. It works almost as an opposite to Leibniz’s: is it possible to create an unsurpassable world? They would argue no by virtue of God’s omnipotence, he could alway create a better world than any world imaginable. Lets look at it from a crudely utilitarian perspective: say you have a paradise of 50 people, you could easily create a paradise with 500 people and so on and so forth if you are an all powerful being. In fact, it is the all powerfullness that prevents him from creating the best of all possible worlds. They go on to argue that just because he cannot do that, that does not mean that God is not himself good. God can create a world whereof a better one could be created or imagined as long as he views it as worth creating. I think we as the creations hope for it to mean that he considered our experience before doing it. This is perhaps the most applicable. Even for our level of power, we can always do better, so this one may apply to us. I would argue though that we have a situation wherein we created a thing without considering it at all and now that we have it, we should at least consider it from our creation’s perspective.</p>

<p>That’s the core of it. There is this huge power differential and a matching indifference that I can’t help but think that we would condemn God for were the shoe on the other foot.</p>

<p>So, I mean this whole theodicy argument. I don’t expect it to compel anyone. I just expect it to shut a door you may try to exit out of if you don’t find this compelling Bentham’s old line on the circle of moral concern:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the question is not whether it reasons, it’s does it suffer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe this a trivial insight, but when I heard it in ethics class it felt like lightning. We all have experience of suffering. We all know at least to some extent what we are inflicting on these beings and we have to ask ourselves why is it good for me to have somewhat more pleasure eating supper at the expense of a horrible bleak existence for these animals, but if you don’t find that compelling I at least ask you think about how you would defend your actions toward the cow from the view of a god.</p>

        <article><p>About a month ago, I saw this video from the youtuber @NoBoilerplate called <em>How to Finish Every Project</em>. He talks about the various things that pull us away from getting things done and one of them is our attatchment to our ideas. Being overly attatched to them overvalues them and prevents us from executing. He says to give your ideas away for free to free your mind and focus on that one thing that you can do. It is the doing that is worth something and maybe someone else can do something with your ideas.</p>

<p>I don’t have facebook anymore, so I haven’t had a place to share my ideas for few years now. So I made this website. It took longer than is probably imaginable given that it is so simple, but I had to learn <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> anyway for a different project so I thought that I would make this using that. I have some satisfaction in it given that it is mostly from scratch using CSS, HTML, Jekyll and Liquid.</p>
